- **Description**<br>
Very simple tray indicator for hard drive read/write activity (for computers lacking the chassis LED)

- **Reasoning**<br>
Since my desktop days (2000-2014) I used to rely on the HD LED ðŸš¨ on the hardware chassis to know if the system was hung or just heavily working on something. However, back in 2015, I was using a very weak laptop (with a dinosaur HDD ðŸ¦•) that lacked that external indicator, so it annoyed me a lot not to know if the PC was frozen or if I should just wait; when the light is constantly on or blinking a lot it means heavy disk operation is being done, otherwise an unresponsive system and a turned off LED means the system certainly crashed, so I developed this very simple (not even an exit button ðŸ˜…) utility to simulate the HD LED as a tray icon indicator.

- **Usage / Features**<br>
Run the *Install.cmd* (as Admin) and it will automatically add the executable to PC initialization, or just run *HDLc.exe* to test drive it.<br>It does not have an exit button (as for the nature of the application, should it?). I made the tray icon light/dark theme agnostic.
